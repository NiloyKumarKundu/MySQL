Consider a paediatrician clinic (for only kids below the age of 15) that will store information regarding
various patients, doctors and their rooms. Patients have a unique id, name, age and date of birth.
Doctors have specific identifiers, name, Nid numbers and joining date. Each patient can be treated by
one doctor only. Doctors have their rooms in the clinic. However, each room may be shared by a
number of doctors. Rooms are in a specific wing of a particular floor and have unique room numbers.
Although the clinic has only 1 floor right now, the construction of other floors will be completed soon
and therefore, floor information is considered necessary.
