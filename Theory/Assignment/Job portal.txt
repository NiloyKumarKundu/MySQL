Consider the following scenario for a Job portal:

▪ The job portal manages each user’s profile where each user is represented by his or her name, unique
email, address, date of birth, educational qualifications, job position and job experience.
Both recruiters and job seekers are user and one recruiter can recruit more than one job seeker.

▪ The recruiters can post job openings to the job portal. 

The job portal keeps track of each posts date, time, contents, no of viewers. The system also keeps track of which job seeker is interested in which job posts.

job seekers                         job_posts

*********Confusion part**********


▪ Each of the offices is maintained by their unique office id, name, address and contact no.
Every user belongs to some offices as a recruiter or, an employee or, a follower.

Each person can provide his or her anonymous review of offices.


Each of the review contains review id, date, time, review details. The review id cannot uniquely identify a particular review but a review id together with an office id can uniquely identify a particular review.

Design and ER Diagram for the scenario that satisfies all the given requirements.
