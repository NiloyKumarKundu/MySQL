Consider the following scenario for Course Management System:

▪ The university stores all the student information that includes a unique student id, name, date of birth,
address. Address is stored in the following three sections: street name, postal code and city.

▪ Each course is identified by its unique course code, trimester, course name and course content.

One course is conducted by several faculties and a student can choose several courses in a single trimester.

course              faculty
1                   ?? many
?? many                1

course              student
1                   ?? many
?? many             1

▪ The university identifies each faculty through their unique employee id. Each faculty also has a particular
room no, name, contact no, email and join date. 

Each faculty is associated with anonymous reviews of students. 

Each review consists of a review id, review details and datetime. 

The review id can’t identify a particular review among all the reviews but the review id for a specific faculty can identify a particular review. 

Each student is also assigned to a specific faculty for advising purpose.
Design an ER Diagram for the scenario that satisfies all the given requirements.
