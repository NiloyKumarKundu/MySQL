Consider the following scenario:

▪ The blog management system maintains each blog writer’s unique email, name, encoded password,
gender, date of birth, join date, length of employment and address.

The address field consists of three components: postal code, city and street name.

Every blog writer is hired by only one blog writer as his employer.
The visitors may follow more than one blog writer.


▪ Each of the blogs has blog id, details, date, time and category.
One blog may fall under several categories.
Here blog id cannot uniquely identify a specific blog but blog id together with blog writer
email can uniquely identify a specific blog. 
A blog writer may publish several blogs.

#########
▪ The visitors can see all the blogs published by writers. 
Each visitor can comment more than one time in each blog and the system maintains the date, time, content of that blog comment.

visitor             comment 
1                   x
1                   y 
3                   


Visitors can also hit reactions (like/dislike) in more than one blogs. The system maintains unique visitor email, visitor name and encrypted password for each visitor.


Design and ER Diagram for the scenario that satisfies all the given requirements.
